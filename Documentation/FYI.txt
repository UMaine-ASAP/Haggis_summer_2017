The term klass is used in place of class. This affects the model primarily. This fix addresses an issue of refering to a class within PHP
programming language. Class is a reserved word for the language, and cannot be used outside of declaring a new class.


MODELS
  When developing models, they must return all data in an array format

    {RESULT CODE, DATA}

    Following this format will ensure that the model will return data compatable with mobile API systems.

    Use the below template to assist you in creating models:

    public static function functionName()
    {
      $errorCode;
      $message;
      $db = Db::getInstance();
      $sql = "";                          //define your SQL string between
      try
      {
        $stmt = $db->prepare($sql);
        $data = array();
        $result = $stmt->execute($data);

        (DO STUFF WITH $RESULT HERE)

        $errorCode  = ;
        $message    = ;
      }
      catch(PDOException $e)
      {
        $errorCode  = $e->getCode();
        $message    = $e->getMessage();
      }

      return array($errorCode, $message);
    }
